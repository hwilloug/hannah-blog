        After moving into my new house, I decided to build some raised beds for gardening! My dad showed me how to use a chop saw, and I got to work. I built two 3.5'x10' beds and two L-shaped 10'x10'x3.5' beds, all 12' deep. The plan is eventually to add two more L-shaped beds to create a nice square garden. I filled each bed with Black Kow compost, but because of the price, I decided to only fill each box up halfway. I'll probably add some more compost in the fall or spring.

        I planted a whole lot of plants in each box. I tried companion planting so that I don't have to worry as much about pests. Below are what I planted in each box:
        <ul>
            <li>Box 1:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Big Boy Tomatoes</li>
                <li>Lemon Boy Tomatoes</li>
                <li>Cherry Tomatoes</li>
                <li>Tomatillos</li>
                <li>Jalape√±o Peppers</li>
                <li>Red Bell Peppers</li>
                <li>Shishito Peppers</li>
                <li>Bush Beans</li>
                <li>Basil</li>
                <li>Parsley</li>
                <li>Borage</li>
                <li>Marigolds</li>
                <li>Leeks</li>
                <li>Garlic</li>
                <li>Buttercrunch Lettuce</li>
                <li>Romaine Lettuce</li>
                <li>Arugula</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Box 2:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Asparagus</li>
                <li>Cosmos</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Box 3:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Ever-bearing Strawberries</li>
                <li>Borage</li>
                <li>Radishes</li>
                <li>Carrots</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Box 4:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Sweet Corn</li>
                <li>Purple Hull Peas</li>
                <li>Yellow Squash</li>
                <li>Zucchini</li>
                <li>Butternut Squash</li>
                <li>Cantelope</li>
                <li>Petunias</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Petunias are supposed to be good for keeping the squash beetles away, so I'm really looking forward to seeing if that works. Borage is new to me as well; it's a wildflower that's supposed to be a good overall pest deterrant.
    </p>
    <p>
        And of course, there's the classic corn/bean/squash "three sisters" combination (although I replaced beans with peas).
    </p>
    <p>
        As for the asparagus/cosmos combination, the cosmos foliage is very similar in appearance to the asparagus fern, so I planted them together.
