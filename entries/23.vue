                It took me forever to decide what to make my mom for Christmas last month. I was scouring Pinterest and the internet for cross stitch ideas (my mom loves needlepoint), and I finally came across <a href="https://www.everythingcrossstitch.com/autumn-band-sampler-mrp-p30737.aspx">this Autumn Band Sampler</a>. When I saw the squirrels, I knew some variation of it would be the perfect gift for my mom.

        <div class="section">
            <img src="@/assets/squirrel_sampler_3.png" />
            <p>
                Here's the final pared-down design I made from the Autumn Band Sampler. I designed it so that it would fit in a frame that I already had, so it ended up being much smaller than the original design (which was fine because I was kind of short on time as Christmas was fast approaching).

        <div class="section">
            <img src="@/assets/squirrel_sampler_1.png" />
            <p>
                In progress...
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <img src="@/assets/squirrel_sampler_2.png" />
            <p>And here is the final result! I was so so so happy with it, and my mom loved it!</p>
