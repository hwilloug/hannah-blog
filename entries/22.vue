                When I came across <a href="https://www.everythingcrossstitch.com/where-the-cake-is-mrp-p94406.aspx?k2=e1">this "home is where the cake is" design</a>, I knew I had to make it for my cake-obsessed boyfriend. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <img src="@/assets/cake_home_4.png" />
            <p>
                I knew I'd have a hard time finding a frame that was long enough for the original design, so I cut off the bottom section. The above screenshot is the pared-down design that I used.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <img src="@/assets/cake_home_1.png" />
            <p>
                In progress...
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <img src="@/assets/cake_home_2.png" />
            <p>
                Almost done!
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <img src="@/assets/cake_home_3.png" />
            <p>
                And here is the final result! I added stitching along the lighter colors' borders so that they'd stand out better against the background fabric color. And I found this frame at a local thrift store that goes with it perfectly!
