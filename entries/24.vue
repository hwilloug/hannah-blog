                After I saw some 3D pie embroideries on Pinterest, I knew I wanted to try to do it as well. I knew I wanted to frame the final design, so I sifted through Pinterest for some text to go with the pies to make it a more complete piece.

        </div>
        <div>
            <img src="@/assets/pies_1.png" />
            <p>
                In progress...
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <img src="@/assets/pies_2.png" />
            <p>
                And here's the final result! I had problems with fraying edges, so I learned not to cut the fabric to size without binding the edges. For this project, the frame covered up most of the fraying, but I am still a unhappy that you can see it a little. Also, I wish I took my time on the pies a bit more so they'd be a little more neat and even. At any rate, I gave this to my Aunt for Christmas, and she loved it!
