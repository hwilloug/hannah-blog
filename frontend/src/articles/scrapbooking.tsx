          After visiting my grandparents in Mississippi, I was inspired to get
          back into printing photos for my photo albums. Scrapbooking was always
          something I have wanted to do, so instead of buying a new photo album
          when I ran out of space for my new photos, I decided to start
          scrapbooking!

          There are pages and pages of cat photos. They truly are my babies ‚ù§Ô∏èüå∏

          And of course I can't help myself but to go overboard. My two binders
          I bought are already full! The first binder is from college, and the
          second album is Boston and beyond. I hope to get a third album for
          before college.

          For now, the pages are mostly filled with pictures, but I am going
          back through and adding little notes and descriptions as well. I have
          some trinkets saved that I've also put in the pages!

        Going through these old photos is helping me process my memories and
        reflect on good and bad times. I've learned so much about myself the
        last few years, and I hope that 2024 is a spectacular year.
