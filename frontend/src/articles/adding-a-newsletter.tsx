          I decided to stick with AWS for the newsletter infrastructure. I added
          a new table to the RDS database that backs this site for storing
          emails, as well as adding lambdas that post new emails, unsubscribe,
          and triggering a new email. The emails are sent using AWS's Simple
          Email Service (SES). Any bounces or complaints are caught with a
          Simple Notification Service (SNS) topic, and pushed to an SQS queue
          respectively for triage.

          Implementing the newsletter was simple enough, and I did a lot of
          trial and error to get it right. Currently, I have the template
          hard-coded into the lambda, but in the future, I'll look into saving
          an SES template for (hopefully) easier formatting and design of the
          emails.
