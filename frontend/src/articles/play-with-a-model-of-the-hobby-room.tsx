          I was watching some videos on portfolio/personal websites, and came
          across a few that were interactable 3D models rendered right in the
          web browser. I knew I had to figure out how to do it as well. I found
          that they used <b>threejs</b> and <b>react-three-fiber</b>, and I was
          able to get a basic scene up and running pretty quickly.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was interested in building a computer that was interactable, then I
          suddenly had the idea to model my hobby room and use it on the blog
          somehow. It's going to be the welcome page, but it is currently a work
          in progress. Play with the beta model now on{" "}

        <p>Here are some challenges I faced while building the model:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Getting the camera to move the way I wanted</li>
          <li>Shadows & lighting</li>
          <li>
            Rendering HTML within the computer screen (before I switched to
            @react-three/fiber)
          </li>
          <li>Compressing the model so it loads more quickly</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Here's a list of things I want to add to the model:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Textures for my favorite books on the bookshelf</li>
          <li>A cat in the cubby of the desk</li>
          <li>Lamps on the top of the desk</li>
          <li>A desk chair</li>
          <li>Window(s)</li>
          <li>Improved texture on the door</li>
          <li>Easter eggs ;)</li>
          <li>Instructions on how to use</li>
          <li>
            A shortcut to the site without having to interact with the model
          </li>
          <li>Lots of small details such as textures on the keyboards</li>
