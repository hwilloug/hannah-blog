          Inspired by the coffee shop I go to nearly every morning,{" "}
          <a href="https://humblecupcoffeeco.com/" target="_blank">
            Humble Cup Coffee Co
          </a>
          , I began a vintage-looking sampler with a coffee theme! Read on for
          tips on finishing an embroidery project, as well as some in progress
          pictures of working this piece.

            Finishing a Needlework Piece for a Frame
          </SectionHeader>
          <p>
            The process for finishing a needlework piece for a frame is just two
            two simple steps:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Block</li>
            <li>Sew to back panel</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            First, I blocked the piece by soaking it in water and pinning it to
            one of those foam kids' playmats with T-pins, then letting it dry.
            This process does a few things: it gets all the wrinkles and creases
            out from using an embroidery hoop, evens out the stitching, and gets
            rid of any erroneous holes you may have poked in the fabric.
          </p>

            alt="blocking the coffee cross stitch piece"
          />
          <p>
            Then, I sewed it together using embroidery thread. I centered the
            piece on the backboard of the frame, then tied a knot at the end of
            the thread and weaved the two long edges together around the
            backboard. This doesn't need to look the prettiest since it's the
            back, but you want to make sure that it's nice and tight so the
            front is completely flat.

          />
          <p>
            I repeated the same process for the short edges, this time folding
            the corners in a bit so they don't show from the front.

        <ul>
          <li>
            Put the T-pins a little larger than the size of the frame so that
            the holes don't show.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fix spacing issues when I notice them while working the piece.
          </li>
          <li>Practice lettering before putting it on the final piece.</li>
